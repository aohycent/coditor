# How to create and manage Web socket Server WSS:

To create a WebSocket server, you'll need a server-side programming language and a library that supports WebSockets. Here's a general approach using `Node.js` and the ws library: 

- Install ws: Use npm to install the ws library for WebSockets in your project:
```code
npm install ws
```

- Create a WebSocket server: In your server-side code, import the WebSocketServer from the ws library and create a new server instance. Specify the port the server will listen on: 
```javascript
    const { WebSocketServer } = require('ws');
    const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });
```

- Handle connections: Add an event listener to the wss object to handle incoming connections. This event will be triggered whenever a client connects to your server: 
```JavaScript
    wss.on('connection', ws => {
        console.log('Client connected');
        ws.on('message', message => {
            console.log('Received: %s', message);
        });
    });
```

- Handle messages: Inside the connection event handler, add another event listener to the WebSocket object ws to handle incoming messages from the client. This event will be triggered whenever the client sends a message to the server: 
```JavaScript
    ws.on('message', message => {
        console.log('Received: %s', message);
        ws.send(`Server received: ${message}`);
    });
```

- Start the server: Run your server code to start the WebSocket server: 
```code
        node your-server-file.js
```
